# Final-Project-Epicode
Last project of the 3-month Epicode bootcamp. Using Angular I built a billing webpage and through the API provided by the school itself I was able to experiment with Angular routing and the problems associated with incorrect or correct login, it was a fun experience where in just four days I managed to build a website with a working login through API calls.
